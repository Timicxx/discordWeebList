# discordWeebList

### A multifunctional discord bot with a few functions

*How to start:*
```
python discordWeebList.py
```

*Commands:*
```
weeb - weeb list menu
trace - you need to attach a screenshot from an anime with this command, the bot finds the exact name, timestampand basically everything of that anime from the screenshot
sauce - finds the source of the image/gif attached (not yet implemented)
yt2mp3 - Converts a youtube video to a mp3 file with ID3 tags, https://github.com/Tymec/yt2mp3
backup - Backs up the weeb list into a json file
```

*Installation:*
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Change the discord token and channel ID (for the channel that the bot uses as the weeb list) in the auth.json file.
You can find out more on how to do this stuff here: https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration/wiki/How-to-get-a-token-and-channel-ID-for-Discord
